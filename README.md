Space Invaders for Pygame
=========================
This is a copy of the good 'ol Space Invaders, an arcade game of the 80s, created with Pygame.
Pygame is a Python wrapper for the graphics library, SDL, which was written in C. 

Do note that if you'd like to change the game variables, please do so in the constructor of the Game class as well as the
variables in the 'restart_game' function.
